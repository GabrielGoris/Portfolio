          <p class="aboutme">
            I am a 24 years old multifaceted individual. I live in
            <a href="#location">Arujá, São Paulo</a> Passionate about continuous
            learning. I embarked on the exciting journey of programming by
            enrolling in the Analysis and Systems Development college program.
            Determined to enhance my skills, I immersed myself in bootcamps,
            videos, podcasts and external courses to complement my knowledge.
            Currently, I am focused on specializing in JavaScript. <br /><br />
            Beyond programming, i am an enthusiast of various hobbies. My
            passion for <a href="#3d">3D modeling</a> and 3D printing allows me
            to materialize my creativity in tangible ways.
            <a href="#writing">Writing</a> and reading hold a special place in
            my routine, providing me an escape to imaginary worlds and a
            platform to express my ideas. <br /><br />
            In summary, I am someone who embraces change, seeks knowledge
            incessantly, and finds satisfaction in a wide range of creative
            activities.
            <br />
            I am excited about the possibilities that the world of programming
            and technology has to offer and look forward to shaping my future in
            this dynamic landscape.

          <p class="hobby">
            I started my hobby as work. As time went on and the search for a job
            became increasingly complex, an idea came to me. I invested in a 3D
            printer and set up a shop using models found on the internet.
            However, after some time, I began studying the subject and started
            using the software Blender to bring my ideas to life.
            <br /><br />
            Now, it's just a hobby that I like to spend my time on when I'm not
            studying programming or working on projects.

          <p class="hobby">
            Since I was a child, I have always been passionate about books. I would always want to visit second-hand bookstores, bookshops, and look for new books. This passion continued as I grew up. Along with this passion, a dream grew with me from a young age: to have my name in a book. 
            <br /><br />
            I achieved this thanks to a publisher called <a target="_blank" href="https://editoraelixir.com.br/">Elixir</a>
            during an "Escritubro," an idea inspired by "Inktober," which takes place in October with a series of 31 drawings, one for each day of the month. In this case, it was 31 micro-stories, created with themes chosen by the publisher via Instagram. In the end, some of the stories were selected, and I was honored to be chosen to participate in the book!
